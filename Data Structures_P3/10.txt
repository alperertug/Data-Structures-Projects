A light flashed in the east
Lucian opened his mouth to speak but his words drowned before they reached Senna s ears Her legs weakened as an overwhelming weight pressed against her chest She lunged for the ship s railing but found Lucian s hand instead
Dark lightning slammed into Senna The jolt sent her crashing against the deck every limb contorted in searing pain her body tensing and twisting as bones threatened to snap A chorus of screams breached her mind The anguished cries resounded and swelled until the world shattered in fragments of blinding light  She felt herself being torn away from Lucian and the boat and the shore and the anchor that held her life in place
