Wolf Lamb tell me a story
Lamb There was once a pale man with dark hair who was very lonely
Wolf  Why was it lonely
Lamb All things must meet this man So they shunned him.
Wolf Did he chase them all
Lamb He took an axe and split himself in two
Wolf So he would always have a friend
Lamb So he would always have a friend
