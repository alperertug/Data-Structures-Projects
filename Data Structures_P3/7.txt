She had a splendid Christmas She went to bed early so as to let Santa Claus have a chance at the stockings and in the morning she was up the first of anybody and went and felt them and found hers all lumpy with packages of candy and oranges and grapes and pocketbooks and rubber balls and all kinds of small presents and her big brothers with nothing but the tongs in them and her young lady sisters with a new silk umbrella and her papas and mammas with potatoes and pieces of coal wrapped up in tissuepaper just as they always had every Christmas Then she waited around till the rest of the family were up and she was the first to burst into the library when the doors were opened and look at the large presents laid out on the librarytablebooks and portfolios and boxes of stationery and breastpins and dolls and little stoves and dozens of handkerchiefs and inkstands and skates and snowshovels and photographframes and little easels and boxes of watercolors and Turkish paste and nougat and candied cherries and dolls houses and waterproofsand the big Christmastree lighted and standing in a wastebasket in the middle .
